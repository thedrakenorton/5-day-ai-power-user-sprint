## Materials
**Copy/paste into ChatGPT**

```text
MINE — From focus_brief.md, ask 4–6 clarifiers (voice traits, taboo phrases, proof, CTA destination, brand adjectives).
CRAFT — Propose a 5‑section outline → wait for “OK”. Then write section‑by‑section drafts; after each, ask “keep/tweak?”
REFINE — Apply tweaks and assemble final copy. Also output: 2 alt H1s + 1 alt subhead. Save as copy_full.md and paste.
```
**Output today:** `copy_full.md` (plus H1/subhead variants)  
**Reply keyword:** `DRAFT`
