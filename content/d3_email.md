# Day 3 — Craft: Write Your Page in Your Voice (15–20 min)

**TL;DR**
- Confirm tone and must/avoid words.
- Draft a 5‑section outline → write sections in short, scannable blocks.
- Include at least one **proof** line. Save `copy_full.md`.

---

## 1) Materials (copy‑paste prompt)

```
MINE — From focus_brief.md, ask 4–6 clarifiers:
• Voice traits (e.g., plain, precise, bold), taboo phrases
• Which proof to include (metric, project, testimonial seed)
• CTA destination details (email/link/handle)
• Pick 2 brand adjectives: minimal, friendly, precise, energetic, classic, futuristic

CRAFT — Propose a 5-section outline → wait for “OK”.
Then write section-by-section drafts. After each section, ask “keep/tweak?”
Make it mobile-scannable: short paragraphs, bullets, bold key lines.

REFINE — Apply tweaks and assemble:
• Final page copy (all sections)
• 2 alt H1s + 1 alt subhead
Save as copy_full.md and paste it.
```

## 2) Copy scaffold (you can paste this and replace brackets)

```
# [Your one‑line promise in plain English]
A short subhead that adds a payoff.

**What this looks like**  
- Bullet with present‑tense outcome  
- Bullet with a concrete artifact  
- Bullet with a risk removed

**Proof**  
- One specific line with a result, artifact, or client name (with permission)

**CTA**  
[One button label that matches the promise]
```

## Acceptance

- `copy_full.md` saved with full sections, one proof, and two alt H1s + one alt subhead.

**Reply keyword:** `DRAFT`
