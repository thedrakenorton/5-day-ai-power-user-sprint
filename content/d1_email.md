# Day 1 — Stop Overthinking → Setup + “Hello World” (15–20 min)

**Skip the video if you want.** This written lesson is complete on its own. The video (when added) will just mirror the steps.

**TL;DR (30s)**
- Create a **ChatGPT Project** and set **Project Instructions**.
- Enable **Custom Instructions**; **Memory** is optional (you control it).
- Open **Canvas**, generate a tiny **Hello World** page, and save three artifacts.

---

## 1) Turn on the right switches (3–5 min)

1. **Create a Project** named `My Website`.  
2. **Add Project Instructions** (paste the block below).  
3. **Custom Instructions (global):** enable and paste the block below.  
4. **Memory (optional):** enable only if you want ChatGPT to recall preferences.  
5. **Canvas:** open a Canvas tab in this project (desktop recommended).

**Paste → Project Instructions**
```
We work in Mine → Craft → Refine (MCR). For each day:
1) Create/append a “L[lesson]-Checklist” in Canvas.
2) Ask first (Mine), then build (Craft), then tighten (Refine).
3) Save artifacts with exact filenames AND paste contents inline for download.
Quality bars: specific > vague, proof > claims, ship > perfect.
```

**Paste → Global Custom Instructions**
```
Collaborative style: friendly, concrete, ask when unsure. Keep replies tight with a clear next step.
Default loop: Mine → Craft → Refine. Writing-first. Offer phrasing options A/B/C.
Canvas & files: paste final artifacts as fenced code blocks with exact filenames.
Tone: plain-spoken, concrete, no hype.
```

## 2) Do the work (8–10 min)

Paste the prompt below into your Canvas chat:

```
MINE — Confirm we’re in my “My Website” Project + Canvas is open (desktop recommended). Ask if I prefer desktop or mobile for today.
CRAFT — Generate a minimal mobile-first HTML page that says “Hello, World” in large type and has one CTA button that scrolls to #start. Name it page.html.
REFINE — Add smooth-scroll JS and comfortable spacing for mobile. Paste page.html as a full file. Also create:
- project_readme.md (2–3 lines on my setup)
- day1_seed.md (audience, one-line promise, desired CTA)
```

**Pro tip:** After it pastes `page.html`, click **Download** (from Canvas code block), then **Upload to Project Files** to persist it.

---

## 3) Ship today’s artifacts

- `project_readme.md` — 2–3 lines on your environment and goal  
- `day1_seed.md` — audience, one‑sentence promise, target CTA  
- `page.html` — the tiny page to prove the loop works

---

## Troubleshooting

- *The page looks weird on mobile.* Ask: “Do a mobile spacing pass and increase body line-height slightly.”  
- *I can’t find Canvas.* Use desktop web; inside a chat, click **Canvas**.  
- *Memory weirdness.* Turn it off; this course works without Memory.

---

## Acceptance

- Canvas open, `page.html` pasted, three artifacts saved/uploaded.

**Reply keyword:** `STARTED`
