# Day 2 — Mine: Focus Brief (15–20 min)

**No video needed.** The written workflow below is the source of truth.

**TL;DR**
- Answer 8 sharp questions (one by one).  
- Synthesize a one‑pager `focus_brief.md` with promise, sections, and CTA.

---

## 1) Materials (copy‑paste prompt)

```
MINE — Ask me these 8 questions one by one and push back on vagueness:
• Results I’ve produced (for me/others)
• Who I enjoy helping (be specific)
• Topics I won’t shut up about
• Proof/assets I can show
• Primary CTA (which + where?)
• Constraints (time, tools, off-limits)
• Must-include / never-include
• What I want visitors to do/feel after reading (in my words)

CRAFT — Synthesize focus_brief.md:
• Purpose (1 sentence) • Audience snapshot (today → after)
• Angle & Promise (1 sentence)
• 3 before→after bullets (concrete)
• Recommended sections (3)
• Primary CTA (+ optional secondary) with exact button label
• Risks/unknowns + one tiny next action

REFINE — Ask me 3 follow-ups to tighten Promise/CTA. Then paste focus_brief.md.
```

## 2) Example (so you can see the target)

**Purpose:** Help indie consultants turn scattered write‑ups into a credible one‑page site.  
**Audience snapshot:** From “good at the work, weak at showing it” → “clear proposition w/ proof.”  
**Angle & Promise:** Plain‑spoken coaching + tiny proofs so prospects feel safe to reach out.  
**Before→After:**  
- “What do I even put?” → “3 clear sections + CTA.”  
- “Feels braggy” → “Proof lines, no hype.”  
- “Site is a chore” → “15‑minute chunks.”  
**Sections:** Hero, What this looks like, Proof, CTA.  
**Primary CTA:** “Email me for a fit check” → **Button:** `Request a fit check`  
**Risks/unknowns:** Low visuals; add 1 tasteful image. **Next action:** collect 1 proof line.

## Acceptance

- `focus_brief.md` uploaded to Project Files; includes promise, 3 sections, CTA, and risks.

**Reply keyword:** `LOCKED`
