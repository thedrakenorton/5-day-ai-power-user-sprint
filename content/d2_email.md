â€¢ Primary CTA (ask which) â€¢ Constraints â€¢ Mustâ€‘include / neverâ€‘include â€¢ What I want visitors to do/feel
CRAFT â€” Synthesize focus_brief.md with:
â€¢ Purpose â€¢ Audience snapshot â€¢ Angle & Promise â€¢ 3 beforeâ†’after bullets â€¢ 3 sections â€¢ Primary CTA (+optional secondary)
â€¢ Risks/unknowns + one tiny next action
REFINE â€” Ask 3 followâ€‘ups to tighten Promise/CTA. Paste focus_brief.md.
