**▶️ Watch (optional):** [Open the Day 2 video]({VIDEO_D2_URL})

## Materials
**Copy/paste into ChatGPT**

```text
MINE — Ask me these 8 questions (one by one) and push back on vagueness:
• Results I’ve produced • Who I enjoy helping • Topics I won’t shut up about • Proof/assets I can show
• Primary CTA (ask which) • Constraints • Must‑include / never‑include • What I want visitors to do/feel
CRAFT — Synthesize focus_brief.md with:
• Purpose • Audience snapshot • Angle & Promise • 3 before→after bullets • 3 sections • Primary CTA (+optional secondary)
• Risks/unknowns + one tiny next action
REFINE — Ask 3 follow‑ups to tighten Promise/CTA. Paste focus_brief.md.
```
**Output today:** `focus_brief.md` (upload to Project)  
**Reply keyword:** `LOCKED`
